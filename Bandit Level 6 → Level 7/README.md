   ```
   ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
   ```
   password: HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG
   ```
   
2. **Search for the File**:
   Use the `find` command to locate the file that matches the specified properties:

   ```
   find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
   ```

   - `/`: Search the entire filesystem.
   - `-user bandit7`: File is owned by the user `bandit7`.
   - `-group bandit6`: File is owned by the group `bandit6`.
   - `-size 33c`: File size is exactly 33 bytes.

   ```
   cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
   ```
